            Hello visitor. My name is Daniel Santiago and I am currently pursuing Web Development as a career path. I am currently located in Palm Beach County, Florida and am looking into joining a knowledgeable team that will be able to push my skills to the limit
            and motivate me to grow into a strong Developer. I will be obtaining my BSIT Degree from Daytona State College in Fall, and received my compTIA A+ certification.
